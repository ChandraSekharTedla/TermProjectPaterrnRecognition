Stock Price Prediction using ARIMA and LSTM

1. Kaggle study how others did
2. Multiple Models (FB Prophet, XG Boost, PCA, Random Forests, Support Vector Regression)

  c. https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model
  d. https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.reshape.html
4. Parameters for comparison
  a. Add multiple companies and use their correlation to guess the new data.
  b. Macroeconomic indices(like GDP, Imports, Exports) used for Stock Price.
  c. Select the company and choose the related indices.
  d. Research done by others in Kaggle to know what to consider.
5. Project Paper
  a. It is important to understand what parameters affect the most and then finding the best model that helps in the prediction.
  b. Data Fetching and cleaning is more important.

ToDo:
1. Make them as functions.
2. Additional Stiff to add.
3. Document to be started.
